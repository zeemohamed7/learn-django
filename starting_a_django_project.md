## Setting up PostgreSQL
It is a powerful, open-source relational database system. We'll use it as the backend database for our Django project.

1. Install PostgreSQL
- macOS (with Homebrew):
```bash
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```
Windows: Download the installer from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) and follow the instructions.

2. pgAdmin (Optional GUI)

pgAdmin is a graphical interface for managing PostgreSQL databases.

You can create databases, users, and run SQL queries without using the command line.

Itâ€™s similar to MongoDB Compass, which is the GUI for MongoDB.

Key difference: PostgreSQL is relational (tables, rows, foreign keys), while MongoDB is NoSQL (documents, collections, JSON-like structure).
